# HYTOPIA SDK Examples

One of the best ways to learn is by example, or maybe there's a type of game you already know you'd like to build but you don't want to start from scratch. This is exactly what HYTOPIA SDK examples are for!

## Using an example as a quickstart project template

To start a new HYTOPIA project based on a project in this examples repo, you can use the `hytopia init` command with the `--template` flag.

For example, if we wanted to create a new project using the `wall-dodge-game` example as our template, we can run:

`bunx hytopia init --template wall-dodge-game`

The value used for --template can be any example project folder found in this examples repo. IE, `hygrounds`, `frontiers-rpg-game`, `pathfinding`, etc.
